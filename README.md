# eagerterrier

I work as a Software Engineering Manager at the BBC for the World Service. We do things like [the open source Simorgh application](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/)

## Why eagerterrier? 

When I was working in restaurants someone called me an eager terrier, which I took to mean enthusiastically tackling tasks with unbound energy, so the name stuck. They could have meant I was yappy and annoying, of course...

## Manager Readme

I wrote this when I was a team lead and haven't updated it in a while

## Manager's Reading

I keep a semi-up-to-date list of books and articles I've found useful over time. I am currently studying for an MSc in Business and Strategic Leadership at Cranfield, so my time for reading for fun has been diminished. Good news is that I'm finished with the course in March 2024, so I should be able to do some reading for fun and development in the Spring.

## The code

Since I've been a manager I don't have too much time for coding, but I like to keep my hand in. I keep pet projects, such as [Peggy Babcock](https://peggybabcock.co.uk/) and do occasional freelance projects.

## Unpopular Opinions

* PHP has been unfairly maligned. Maybe too late with PHP7 and it had already lost the fight, but man it was fast.
* Spaces won. Shouldn't have. Tabs FTW
* A pie is anything you call a pie. Like art.
