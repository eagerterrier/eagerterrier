# eagerterrier

I work as a Software Engineering Manager at the BBC for the World Service. We do things like [the open source Simorgh application](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/)

## Why eagerterrier? 

When I was working in restaurants someone called me an eager terrier, which I took to mean enthusiastically tackling tasks with unbound energy, so the name stuck. They could have meant I was yappy and annoying, of course...

## Manager Readme

I wrote this when I was a team lead and haven't updated it in a while

## The code

Since I've been a manager I don't have too much time for coding, but I like to keep my hand in. I keep pet projects, such as [Peggy Babcock](https://peggybabcock.co.uk/) and do occasional freelance projects.
